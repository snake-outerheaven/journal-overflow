/*
        Write a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper
        number of blanks to space to the next tab stop.
        Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns.
        Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter?

        this is exercise 1-20.

#define TABSIZE 8 /*just like linux source code.*/
